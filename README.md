#Minimalistic DEMO app for Ti.DrawerLayout module

Module located at [Ti.DrawerLayout module at https://github.com/Tripvi/Ti.DrawerLayout](Ti.DrawerLayout module at https://github.com/Tripvi/Ti.DrawerLayout)

Simply run this app and tap on the white background to toggle the drawer.

Notice that as mentioned on a ticket (https://github.com/Tripvi/Ti.DrawerLayout/issues/3) they weren't able to implement the "hamburger" icon on the ActionBar.  You could add the toggle code to the onHomeIconItemSelected event of the ActionBar.

I have also included an APK in case you only want to test it out.
